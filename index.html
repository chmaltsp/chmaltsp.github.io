                <p>Novel Food Sciences is an online resource for innovation in food technology. I have been with this project since its birth in 2011 and it has been awesome to watch it grow. It is more or less a place where food producers, innovators, growers and scientists can learn about the latest advancements in the field. We have gone from providing pre-recorded lectures to webinars and back and now have focused on brining new food technology businesses to light via live webinars, our newsletter, and blog. </p>

                <h3>The Problem:</h3>
                <p>The old website hadn't been updated in 4 years and content organization was becoming difficult. It was time for a new look and I was up for the challenge. Some of the things that needed to change were: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Make the website responsive</li>
                    <li>Provide a better way to organize products</li>
                    <li>Make social sharing easy and available for every page</li>
                    <li>Update the Branding</li>
                    <li>Ensure everything is trackable to increase conversion</li>
                </ul>

            <div class="con-text half pad-right">
                <h3>Finding a Better Solution</h3>
                <p>I began my journey by asking our speakers and content makers what would make their lives easier and would drive their effort to contribute. One item that stood out was a way for them to be post content that was easy and not hard to learn technically. After looking through a couple of CMS Systems, the easiest and most versatile was Wordpress. I pitched a few different options to our speakers and settled on a basic framework that included Woo Commerce, a blog, and a way to sell courses and event tickets.</p>

                <h3>Branding</h3>
                <p>The NFS brand also needed an update so I worked with our graphic designer to keep our current idea but make it into a flat design. NFS is represented by an atom, an apple and book to symbolize food, science and knowledge. We dropped the book because it wasn't as pleasing aesthetically when flat. The colors remained similar and we kept the light blue and orange.</p>

                <h2>Responsive</h2>
                <p>I looked at our google analytics and noticed that over 60% of our users were using mobile devices, especially after opening a newsletter. I made sure the website was responsive on every product page and more. I used a mixture of media queries and Javascript to edit the theme to look good on all devices and it led to an increase of traffic and subscribers!</p>

                <h2>< CODE /></h2>
                <p>Since this was a wordpress based solution, there was a relatively steep curve of learning how to customize an existing theme. I took the basic layout and functionality from an e-learning theme called University and changed most of the styling. I also learned about PHP and how different functions in WP communicate to each other. I had to edit a few of the functions of our course library to make sure prices of courses transfer over between our product pages, banners, and checkout. </p>

                <h2>What I Did</h2>
                <p>For this project I was in charge of pretty much everything. Aside from some graphic design, I re-designed the product, did the user research, came up with a proof of concept, and eventually designed and developed the website. I wear a lot of hats for NFS and these are just a few. I also organize all of the webinars, create email marketing materials, provide customer support, and manage communications with our speakers. Here are some stats on the right about how we've grown since the redesign. </p>

                    I was the lead designer on the project and talked with the founder about the goals of the site and eventually the needs he has for his brand. I was provided with a logo that had an orange color and made some complimentary color suggestions using Adobe Color. After that it was off to the races and we began making some wireframes using UX Pin.

The layout we came up with included a big hero image to grab attention with a big orange button to learn more. Then it was going to have a section that listed the features and another for the benifits of the product. Lastly we put in a contact form and a link to the twitter account.</p>

                <p class="white">Since there was a need for a contact form I decided to go ahead and use Angular JS. Since the actual program will eventually be using it I was asked export the data collected from the form in JSON. Also, the live form validation and simplicity of making an AJAX call was a plus. I created a ng-app controller and fed the forms through and had it read a success message on submition. Check out my code on the left. (Form isn't attached to a service in the example) </p>

                <p class="white">We ended up scrapping the features section and instead went with a consolidated benefits section instead to keep it concise. Once things were functional, I added wow.js and some CSS3 animations to give the page a little bit of flair. Also, I added a scrollTop function in JQuery to go between sections smoothly. The deliverables included a style guide, the raw files, and documentation of the landing page. </p>

            <hr/>
            <p>I'm a musician and producer/engineer with a passion for new and emerging technologies, entrepreneurship, and hot jams. With a background in music production and a degree from Berklee College of Music I would consider myself a self-learner. I've always had an interest in tech since I was a child and have taught myself Front End Web development. I am on a quest to marry my passion for music and the bustling startup/tech world. </p>
